## What is this?

This is the theme for my [blog](http://blogger.chunnorris.net/).

It is based on the default "Picture Window" template from [blogger](https://www.blogger.com/home), with some modification:

- Added a neat Dropdown menu tabs modified from [helplogger](http://helplogger.blogspot.in/2014/02/add-a-neat-css-dropdown-menu-in-blogger.html).

- Added [google-code-prettify](https://code.google.com/p/google-code-prettify) code highlight, and a customized CSS snippet modified from [this blog](http://eric0806.blogspot.tw/2014/04/blogger-google-code-prettify.html).

- The width, layout, font-size, font-family, and others have also been modified based on my own preference.
